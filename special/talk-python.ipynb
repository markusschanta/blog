    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bio\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m a Founding Partner of BlueBalance Capital, independent, owner-managed alternative asset management company based in Vienna. I’ve done that for over 3 years now. Before that I was a quant at the London-based asset management firm Man Group and before that, I was a quantitative strategist (Strat) at Goldman Sachs. I hold a Masters degree in Computer Science from Columbia University in New York, where I also received a Fulbright Scholarship and a Bachelors degree from Vienna University of Technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do you do day-to-day?\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise it in a concise answer, I’d say I analyse data. In my day-to-day job, that is very often a piece of financial data and most of the time it’s with the intention to better understand some economic development, a company or an industry. In technical terms, that means a lot of data wrangling in Python using pandas or visualising data. I used to quip that I make a living chaining pandas functions together in fancy ways. For better or worse it’s not far from the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How did you get into programming? Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying a computer when I was 10 years old was probably the best career decision my parents ever made for me. Started programming when I was 12 in C. That didn’t go to well. Learned Borland Delphi in high school. At Vienna University of Tech, the curriculum was mostly Java (2006), but also some Haskell and Prolog. First came in touch with Python at Columbia (2011). At Goldman, we used a proprietary language (Slang/SecDB). Man Group was Python, that’s where I learned “proper” Python. Been using it ever since for Data analysis/research/automation."
